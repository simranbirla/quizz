> Everybody has made an Quiz App. The difference in this app is you can make your own api for fetching questions in the frontend of the app.You only need a little knowledge of backend and then you can create a fully functional api. When you enter the admin mode you can also add a new question.

### Demo
https://quizwebapp.netlify.app/

### Info 
The project has 2 parts :
- FrontEnd

The whole server code is in the folder 
quiz-api/

#### Make 2 folders :
- Copy the whole code of frontend in one folder 
- Take the quiz-api outside the folder and use ```npm init ```
